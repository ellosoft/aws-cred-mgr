## Usage

### Okta Configuration

```plaintext
aws-cred-mgr okta setup
```

#### Examples

-   Simply run `aws-cred-mgr okta setup` to use interactive mode.
-   Set up with domain and username: `aws-cred-mgr okta setup -d https://xyz.okta.com -u john --mfa push`

### Credential Management

```plaintext
aws-cred-mgr cred [COMMAND]
```

#### Subcommands

-   `new`: Create a new credential profile.
-   `get`: Get AWS credentials for an existing credential profile
-   `list` (alias `ls`): List all saved credential profiles.

#### Examples

-   Create a new credential profile named `prod`: `aws-cred-mgr cred new prod`
-   List credentials: `aws-cred-mgr cred ls`
-   Get the AWS credentials for `prod` and stores it in ~/.aws/credentials: `aws-cred-mgr cred get prod`

### RDS Token Management

```plaintext
aws-cred-mgr rds [COMMAND]
```

#### Examples

-   Get RDS password : `aws-cred-mgr rds pwd`
-   Get RDS password for `prod_db`: `aws-cred-mgr rds pwd prod_db`
-   Get RDS password with all options: `aws-cred-mgr rds pwd -h localhost -p 5432 -u john`

### Config Files

```plaintext
aws-cred-mgr config
```

#### Examples

-   Open user config: `aws-cred-mgr config`
-   Open AWS credentials file: `aws-cred-mgr config aws`

### Configuration

The `config` section in the YAML file allows you to set global tool configurations:

-   `copy_to_clipboard`: When set to `true`, the tool will automatically copy generated passwords to the clipboard. Default is `true`.
-   `aws_ignore_configured_endpoints`: When set to `true`, the tool will ignore any pre-configured AWS endpoints. This can be useful in certain network environments. Default is `true`.

## Security Note for Windows and macOS Users

On Windows systems, `aws-cred-mgr` securely stores your Okta credentials using the Data Protection API (DPAPI).
This ensures that your sensitive information is encrypted and can only be accessed by your user account on your computer.

On macOs systems, `aws-cred-mgr` securely stores your Okta credentials using the native Keychain API.

Linux support is still under development

## Full Configuration Example

You can specify additional variables, templates, credentials, and RDS configurations in the YAML file `aws_cred_mgr.yml` located in your home folder

```yaml
variables:
    rds_username: my.user
    default_pwd_lifetime: 15
    # any variable can be specified here
---

    okta:
        default: # default Okta profile name, additional profiles can also be created
            okta_domain: https://xyz.okta.com/
            preferred_mfa_type: push
            auth_type: classic

credentials:
    my_aws_dev_account: # credentials can be interactively created with `aws-cred-mgr cred new`
        role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123:role:/my_aws_role_arn
        aws_profile: default
        okta_app_url: https://xyz.okta.com/home/amazon_aws/abc/272
